## Productionalizing Data Science
* Intro - Model Files, Metrics (Jupyter Notebooks)
* Document - Git is great but notebooks are not good for source control, Convert using Python, Include all the notes on whats going on.
    * Extra external data stored to be used going forward.
* Seperate little functions that integrate what comes from the notebook
* Enhance using automated metric collection, AutoML
* Data Science doesnt stop at the notebook
