# Ignite Talks

## Productionalizing Data Science
* Intro - Model Files, Metrics (Jupyter Notebooks)
* Document - Git is great but notebooks are not good for source control, Convert using Python, Include all the notes on whats going on.
    * Extra external data stored to be used going forward.
* Seperate little functions that integrate what comes from the notebook
* Enhance using automated metric collection, AutoML
* Data Science doesnt stop at the notebook

## It's not fail fast Its learn faster
* Failure is common
* Failure why science is successfull
* Wasteful Experience - ex. Reboot computer - lose logs
* Ugly Experience - ex. Quebec bridge collapse - eng ignores warning sights
* Large Blast Radius - ex. Sully Mircile on the Hudson
* Low Blast Radius - ex. Pixar films, cheap to reproduce
* Premortem
* Failure Weeks
* Software Blackboxes
* Failure is feedback
* Expect failure, set system to learn from it
* Feature your failures
* Tell Your Story!
* End Result -> Better Projects

## Infrastructure Changes
* Modules
* Versioning
* Why infra changes
    * Bare Metal
    * Client-Specific Deploy
* Infra goals
    * CI Builds
    * Automated Test
* Obey the Build
    * Services, computer, networking
* Phased Deployments
* Decouple Child Modules
* Version Child Module

## DevSecOps is a misnomer
* Status Quo
    * Lost in Translation
* People, Process, Tech integration
* Security exists in all parts of the DevOps stages (DevOps Infinity Symbol)

# Resilience Engineering - Alspaw
* Non-incident time - Resilience Engineering
    * 20 year old field, community
* Activities to sustain adaptation
* Plays out in:
    * Unforseen
    * Unantapicpated
* Understanding RE will take time
    * Concepts are not intuitive
