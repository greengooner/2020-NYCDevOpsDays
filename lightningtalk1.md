## Productionalizing Data Science
* Intro - Model Files, Metrics (Jupyter Notebooks)
* Document - Git is great but notebooks are not good for source control, Convert using Python, Include all the notes on whats going on.
    * Extra external data stored to be used going forward.
* Seperate little functions that integrate what comes from the notebook
* Enhance using automated metric collection, AutoML
* Data Science doesnt stop at the notebook

## It's not fail fast Its learn faster
* Failure is common
* Failure why science is successfull
* Wasteful Experience - ex. Reboot computer - lose logs
* Ugly Experience - ex. Quebec bridge collapse - eng ignores warning sights
* Large Blast Radius - ex. Sully Mircile on the Hudson
* Low Blast Radius - ex. Pixar films, cheap to reproduce
* Premortem
* Failure Weeks
* Software Blackboxes
* Failure is feedback
* Expect failure, set system to learn from it
* Feature your failures
* Tell Your Story!
* End Result -> Better Projects
